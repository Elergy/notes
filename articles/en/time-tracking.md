# 3 Things You Might Get by Tracking Time

I started tracking time several years ago. It was new and exciting in the beginning. After a little while I found it boring and exhaustive.  
Eventually it became a habit.

When I started, I didn't know what to track and how to do it. Should I log time only for projects at work or for anything? Should I track how much time I spend watching TV?

I didn't have this answers. Most importantly, I dind't have any goals neither –– I just wanted to try some kind of [lifelogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self) because the concept inself was very interesting at that time.  

You can't be disappointed if you don't have any expectations, so I was positively surprised by the results I was able to achieve:

  - [Less context switching](#less-context-switching)
  - [Realistic picture of effort](#realistic-picture-of-effort)
  - [Better estimation](#better-estimation)

## Less context switching
When I say "time tracking", I mean "manual time tracking".  
I open an app on my computer or smartphone, fill a couple of fields about what I'm doing and press "Start". Or I just select something from the history if I did it in the past.  

Nobody complained but I suppose that sometimes it can be annoying for people around me.  
Imagine the situation: I work on something on the laptop and a colleague comes with a question
> Colleague: Hi, do you have a couple of minutes?  
> Me: \<picks the phone>  
> Me: \<opens an app, does several taps>  
> Me: \<puts the phone in place>  
> Me: Sure, what's up?

Luckely they know that I'm not just checking my Instagram feed –– but it may look a bit weird. Just a bit.  

The reasoning behind this strange movements is that I want to have accurate statistics. More or less. When someone asks me for a couple of minutes, it never takes 2 minutes. It seems obvious that I should stop my current timer –– otherwise data would be incorrect.  

*Well, you say, but what's about online communications? If you track when somebody distracts you offline, shouldn't you do the same when you get a new message?* 



(you don't look for distractions, you avoid it!)
